## Core Workflows

### 1. Project Setup Workflow
```
1. Create new project → 2. Upload dataset → 3. Define label schema → 
4. Configure auto-labeling → 5. Set review parameters → 6. Launch project
```

**Detailed Steps:**
- User creates new labeling project with name and description
- User uploads raw data files (images, text, audio, etc.)
- User defines label categories, classes, and annotation guidelines
- User selects appropriate auto-labeling models and confidence thresholds
- User configures human review workflow and quality control settings
- System validates setup and launches automated labeling process

### 2. Auto-Labeling Workflow
```
1. Data preprocessing → 2. Model inference → 3. Confidence scoring → 
4. Auto-approve high confidence → 5. Queue low confidence for review
```

**Detailed Steps:**
- System preprocesses uploaded data for model compatibility
- Pre-trained models generate labels for each data sample
- System calculates confidence scores for each prediction
- High-confidence labels (above threshold) are automatically approved
- Low-confidence labels are queued for human review
- System tracks progress and updates project status

### 3. Human Review Workflow
```
1. Receive review task → 2. Review auto-generated labels → 3. Accept/Modify/Reject → 
4. Submit feedback → 5. Update model performance
```

**Detailed Steps:**
- Annotator receives notification of pending review tasks
- Annotator reviews auto-generated labels with original data
- Annotator accepts correct labels, modifies partial labels, or rejects incorrect ones
- Annotator submits feedback with corrected annotations
- System incorporates feedback to improve future auto-labeling accuracy

### 4. Quality Assurance Workflow
```
1. Random sample selection → 2. Independent review → 3. Agreement calculation → 
4. Identify conflicts → 5. Resolution and approval
```

**Detailed Steps:**
- System randomly selects samples for quality review
- Multiple reviewers independently assess label quality
- System calculates inter-annotator agreement scores
- Conflicts and disagreements are flagged for resolution
- Final labels are approved and added to training dataset

### 5. Export & Integration Workflow
```
1. Select export format → 2. Configure parameters → 3. Generate export → 
4. Download/API access → 5. Integration with ML pipeline
```

**Detailed Steps:**
- User selects desired export format and configuration
- System generates labeled dataset in specified format
- User downloads labeled data or accesses via API
- Labeled data is integrated into ML training pipeline
- System provides integration documentation and support
